# Job Recruitment Analysis-

The main objective of this project is to analyse a dataset on job recruitment of people using statistical concepts. The data frame consists of 12 attributes and a total of 200 rows. Sorting concept is used where graphs using sorted values are used for better visual representation than unsorted graphs.

Next decision trees concept is used consisting of entropy method where accuracy is predicted by training the data frame. Naive bayes theorem is also implemented similar to decision tree using gaussian method. 
The accuracies from decision tree and naïve bayes theorem are compared and inferred to be more or less similar having accuracy rate of 80% approximately. 

Also visualizations are done to infer the results and draw conclutions using Power BI.

Therefore, the advantage of sorted graphs is analysed and comparison of accuracies from naïve bayes theorem and decision trees are inferred in this project.
